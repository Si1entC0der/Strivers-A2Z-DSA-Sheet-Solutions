 Editorial: Pow(x, n) - Fast Exponentiation

This C++ solution efficiently computes `x` raised to the power `n` (`x^n`) using
binary exponentiation, a method that reduces the time complexity from O(n)
(naive approach) to O(log n).

# Key Steps:
1. Handle Negative Exponents:
   - If `n` is negative, convert the problem to `(1/x)^(-n)`.
   - Using `long long` avoids overflow when handling `INT_MIN`.

2. Binary Exponentiation (Iterative Approach):
   - Break down `n` into binary powers: For example, `x^13 = x^8 * x^4 * x^1`.
   - Multiply `res` only when the current bit is set (`N & 1`).
   - Square `x` and halve `N` in each iteration (`x *= x`, `N /= 2`).

# Edge Cases & Optimizations:
  - Zero Exponent: Returns `1.0` (since `x^0 = 1`).
  - Overflow Handling: No risk of overflow due to logarithmic steps.
  - Efficiency: Performs O(log n) multiplications instead of O(n).

This approach is optimal for large exponents and is widely used in competitive
programming and numerical computations.

A clean, efficient, and mathematically elegant solution! ðŸ”¥
